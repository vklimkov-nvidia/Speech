"""EasyMagpieTTS model definition for vLLM-Omni.

This package provides an inference-only re-implementation of EasyMagpieTTS
(decoder-only, Nemotron-H hybrid-Mamba backbone + autoregressive local
transformer over the stacked audio codebooks) that plugs into the vLLM-Omni
serving stack via the standard ``preprocess`` / ``postprocess`` /
``make_omni_output`` hooks.

The companion ``vllm_plugin_easymagpie_omni`` package registers the model with
vLLM's ``ModelRegistry`` through the ``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point.
